## Model Providers

This template ships with OpenAI `gpt-4o` as the default. However, with the [AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs), you can switch LLM providers to [OpenAI](https://openai.com), [Anthropic](https://anthropic.com), [Cohere](https://cohere.com/), and [many more](https://sdk.vercel.ai/providers/ai-sdk-providers) with just a few lines of code.

## Deploy Your Own

You can deploy your own version of the Next.js AI Chatbot to Vercel with one click:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fai-chatbot&env=AUTH_SECRET,OPENAI_API_KEY&envDescription=Learn%20more%20about%20how%20to%20get%20the%20API%20Keys%20for%20the%20application&envLink=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fai-chatbot%2Fblob%2Fmain%2F.env.example&demo-title=AI%20Chatbot&demo-description=An%20Open-Source%20AI%20Chatbot%20Template%20Built%20With%20Next.js%20and%20the%20AI%20SDK%20by%20Vercel.&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Fchat.vercel.ai&stores=[{%22type%22:%22postgres%22},{%22type%22:%22blob%22}])

## Running locally

You will need to use the environment variables [defined in `.env.example`](.env.example) to run Next.js AI Chatbot. It's recommended you use [Vercel Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables) for this, but a `.env` file is all that is necessary.

> Note: You should not commit your `.env` file or it will expose secrets that will allow others to control access to your various OpenAI and authentication provider accounts.

1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Link local instance with Vercel and GitHub accounts (creates `.vercel` directory): `vercel link`
3. Download your environment variables: `vercel env pull`

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Your app template should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

## Blocks

The chatbot template includes a powerful "Blocks" system that provides a canvas-like interface for working with AI-generated content. The template ships with four built-in blocks:

- **Text Block**: Work with text content like drafting essays and emails
- **Code Block**: Write and execute code (Python)
- **Image Block**: Edit, annotate, and process images
- **Sheet Block**: Work with tabular data

You can also create custom blocks to extend the functionality. See [our documentation](./docs/03-blocks.md) for more information on creating custom blocks.
